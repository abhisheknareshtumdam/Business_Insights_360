## **Company Background**

**AtliQ Hardware** has rapidly expanded globally, selling computers and accessories through **Retailers, Direct,** and **Distributors**. Recently, it faced losses due to opening a store in America based on surveys and intuition rather than deep analytics. With competitors investing heavily in data analytics, AtliQ Hardware is now building its analytics team to enable data-driven insights.

**Project Kick-Off Session**

- Clarifying project goals and objectives
- Key questions before starting dashboard development:
  - Objective of the Power BI dashboard
  - Success criteria for the project
  - Time deadlines and stakeholder expectations
  - Previews and feedback mechanisms
  - Stakeholder hopes, fears, and target users
  - Potential issues and required resources/data

After the kick-off session, the **data engineering team** provided data as requested, ready for exploration.

## **Dataset Understanding**

Understanding available data is essential before analysis.

### **Dimensional Table:**
Contains static data such as **customer** and **product details**

- **dim_customer**: 27 markets (e.g., India, USA, Spain), 75 customers, 2 platforms (Brick & Mortar, E-commerce)
- **dim_market**: 27 markets, 7 sub-zones, 4 regions (APAC, EU, LATAM, nan)
- **dim_product**: Divisions: P & A, N & S; Categories include Internal HDD, Keyboard

### **Fact Tables:**
Contain transactional data

- **fact_forecast_monthly**: Forecasting customer needs to enhance satisfaction and reduce warehouse costs
- **fact_sales_monthly**: Similar structure to fact_forecast_monthly, replacing forecast with sold quantity
- **gdb056** tables: freight_cost, gross_price, manufacturing_cost, pre_invoice_deductions, post_invoice_deductions

### **Data Importation in Power BI**

The **MySQL database** was imported into Power BI using database credentials.

## **Data Modeling**

Data modeling is fundamental for report performance. Poor data modeling affects report performance, and following good practices is essential. We used **Snowflake data modeling** in this project. [Refer to good practices here](https://addendanalytics.com/blog/data-modelling-best-practices/)
